3. **Socket Integration** (`frontend/hooks/useSocket.ts`)
   - Extended socket hook for notification events
   - Real-time notification reception
   - Unread count updates

4. **UI Integration**
   - Updated dashboard header with notification dropdown
   - Real-time badge showing unread count

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Notification Types Supported

### Database Design
```javascript

    postId: ObjectId,       // Related post
    projectId: ObjectId,    // Related project
    chatId: ObjectId,       // Related chat
    url: String,            // Navigation URL
    image: String           // Optional image
  },
  isRead: Boolean,          // Read status
  readAt: Date,            // When it was read
  isDeleted: Boolean,      // Soft delete
  createdAt: Date,         // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date          // Update timestamp
}
```

- Error handling is comprehensive with proper fallbacks
- The system is scalable and can handle high notification volumes

The notification system is now fully functional and ready for use! üéâ
